# Zolo_Web_Scrape

In this section i will be scraping zolo for details.

Overview:
    - Section 1: Scraping Zolo Real Estate Website
    - Section 2: Basic Analysis
    - Section 3: Analysing with Visualizations
    
Targeted Website: https://www.zolo.ca/

#### Objective
My goal is to get webscraped data that has at least 1000 houses for analysis. Please refer to notebook for further details
#### Roadblocks
Zolo will not give you full listing details unless you have an account with them. I had to use selenium to simulate a sign in.
I have issues with my chromedriver so i used firefox instead.

# Conclusion:
Certain Brokerages like FOREST HILL REAL ESTATE INC. may have fewer listings than RIGHT AT HOME REALTY but still come 
close to listing valuation. This suggests that brokerages like FOREST HILL REAL ESTATE INC., tend to specialize in 
more expensive listings. FOREST HILL REAL ESTATE INC (24 listings, Listing Value;40633560). 

There are more listings concentrated close to the 1000 square feet range. This has produced Right Skewed distribution in both graphs. Most Square Ft is clustered to the left side. This suggests listings are more lkely with 1-2 bedroom due to small square foot size.

GIVEN THE AFFORDABILITY OF THE 1 AND 2 BEDROOM IT MAKES SENSE AS TO WHY THERE ARE MORE LISTINGS ON IT
